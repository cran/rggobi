_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Generate the connecting edges for longitudinal data

     create_time_edges(data, time = "Time", obsUnit = "ID")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    data: the dataset from which to compute the edge connections.

    time: name/index of time variable

 obsUnit: name/index of ID variable

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     This function takes a data frame containing records with repeated
     measurements for a given observational unit and generates the
     appropriate edge information so that consecutive time points can
     be connected in a GGobi display. The output of this function can
     be given to setEdges to enable viewing these time series plots for
     individuals.

     Currently this only works if the data are sorted by ID. This will
     be fixed in the future as it requires re-ordering the records from
     the original dataset.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A matrix with 2 columns and as many rows as in original data. 
     Each row in this matrix gives a directed line segment connecting
     one point in time to the next point in time
