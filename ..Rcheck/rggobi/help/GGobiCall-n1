   .name: the simple name of the C routine to be resolved

          routine as its last argument

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     '.GGobiC' and '.GGobiCall' convert the name and then call their C
     invocation counterparts.

     These functions map the simple name of a C routine into the
     package-specific version of that name.  These allow use to hide
     the use a name \textit{mangling} scheme of our choosing for the C
     level routines in the shared library/DLL that provides the glue
     between R and ggobi.  This is useful for avoiding name conflicts
     with other C code in R or other packages.  These are only of
     relevance to the developers of this package and those working with
     its C code.

     The mapping of the name to its corresponding C routine name is
     done in conjunction with the pre-processor macro 'RS_GGOBI'. These
      must be synchronized.
