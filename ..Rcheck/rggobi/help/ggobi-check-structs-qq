     This function is called when the Rggobi library is loaded and it
     verifies that the sizes of the different internal data structures
     for GGobi are the same for both the GGobi shared library/DLL and
     the Rggobi package. This is important as the two shared libraries
     are compiled separately and may have different compilation flags,
     etc. that make them incompatible. This function simply compares
     the sizes of the two views of the structures and raises a warning
     if they do not agree.

     Essentially, you should never notice this function. A warning
     implies that you need to re-install Rggobi against the version of
     GGobi you are using.

     @value TRUE if the sizes in the two libraries are the same,
     otherwise a named logical vector indicating which structures are
     different

_V_a_l_u_e:

     TRUE if the sizes in the two libraries are the same, otherwise a
     named logical vector indicating which structures are different
