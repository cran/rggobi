# Check structs
# Validates GGobi and Rggobi views of internal data structures
# 
# This function is called when the Rggobi library is loaded and it verifies
# that the sizes of the different internal data structures for GGobi are the
# same for both the GGobi shared library/DLL and the Rggobi package. This is
# important as the two shared libraries are compiled separately and may have
# different compilation flags, etc. that make them incompatible. This
# function simply compares the sizes of the two views of the structures and
# raises a warning if they do not agree.
# 
# Essentially, you should never notice this function. A warning implies that
# you need to re-install Rggobi against the version of GGobi you are using.
# 
# @value TRUE if the sizes in the two libraries are the same, otherwise a named logical vector indicating which structures are different
